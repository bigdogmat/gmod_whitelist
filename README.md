# Whitelist

This adds a server-side whitelist to Garry's Mod servers. The features included are a custom menu, kick reason, and the ability to change which ranks are allowed to change these features. By default the usergroups "admin" and "superadmin" have the ability to change most aspects of the whitelist.

# Notes

This addon is currently not finished and most aspects in the menu are not functional. While this addon isn't finished the base console commands are done so it can still be used as a whitelist.
